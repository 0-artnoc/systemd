This is a short list of things that needs to be done.  They are in no specific
order.  I will gladly accept patches for any of these items, or any other stuff
people offer up.

- more documentation (can never have too much.)
- document the config file format (it will change over time...)
- add proper man page
- add klibc to the build process (or make it easier to do) to get
  smaller binary
- import latest libsysfs and convert udev to use it.
- On remove, look up the device in the database (now that we have one) and
  delete what was created, not what the kernel is calling the device.
- add symlink generation and removal support
- better partition support (it's a hack right now, maybe new libsysfs changes
  can help out a lot here.)
- allow database to be queried by other programs
- split program into two pieces (daemon and helper that sends events to it).
  This will allow us to keep track of sequences, and lots of other needed
  stuff.
- keep track of current permissions on devices when daemon shuts down.
- better permission handling
- create kernel name to devfs name config file so that all of the devfs users
  will have an upgrade path.
- make program work like design says it should (three parts, not 1)
- add hooks to call D-BUS when new node is created or removed
- lots of other stuff...
