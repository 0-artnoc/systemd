Bugfixes:

* swap units that are activated by one name but shown in the kernel under another are semi-broken

* NM should pull in network.target (PENDING)
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692008

* make anaconda write timeout=0 for encrypted devices

* fix broken Sockets=syslog-ng.socket packaging

* logind: ensure ACLs are updated on login and logout

* fix CUPS .path unit for globbing

* service: pid file reading after reload doesn't work, since we don't reset the pid variable

* make sure timeouts are applied to Type=oneshot services.

Features:

* rename systemd-logger to systemd-stdio-syslog-bridge

* file bugs against sysklogd, syslog-ng because of StandardOuput=null
* turn default stdout/stderr to syslog (after rsyslog got updated)

* add gperf support for unit file parsing table

* move PAM code into its own binary

* warn if the user stops a service but not its associated socket

* logind: spawn user@..service on login

* logind: non-local X11 server handling

* logind: use sysfs path in device hash table instead of sysname, as soon as fb driver is fixed

* implement Register= switch in .socket units to enable registration
  in Avahi, RPC and other socket registration services.

* make sure people don't leave processes around after ExecStartPre=

* make sure systemd-ask-password-wall does not shutdown systemd-ask-password-console too early

* readahead: use BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG_RANGE instead of BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG ioctl, with START_IO

* readahead: check whether a btrfs volume includes ssd by checking mount flag "ssd"

* support sd_notify() style notification when reload begins (RELOADING=1), reload is finished (READY=1)

* support sd_notify() style notification when shutting down, to make auto-exit bus services work (STOPPING=1)

* verify that the AF_UNIX sockets of a service in the fs still exist
  when we start a service in order to avoid confusion when a user
  assumes starting a service is enough to make it accessible

* Make it possible to set the keymap independently from the font on
  the kernel cmdline. Right now setting one resets also the other.

* move nss-myhostname into systemd

* inform myllynen@redhat.com about standard place to configure timezone name,

* and a dbus call to generate target from current state

* detect LXC with $container=lxc

* drop /.readahead on bigger upgrades with yum

* add inode nr check to readahead to suppress preloading changed files

* show enablement status in systemctl status

* add support for /bin/mount -s

* GC unreferenced jobs (such as .device jobs)

* add JoinControllers= to system.conf to mount certain cgroup
  controllers together in order to guarantee atomic creation/addition
  of cgroups

* avoid DefaultStandardOutput=syslog to have any effect on StandardInput=socket services

* cgroup_notify_empty(): recursively check groups up the tree, too

* when failing to start a service due to ratelimiting, try again later, if restart=always is set

* write blog stories about:
  - enabling dbus services
  - status update
  - how to make changes to sysctl and sysfs attributes
  - remote access
  - cgroup best pratices to avoid stepping on each others toes
  - how to pass throw-away units to systemd, or dynamically change properties of existing units
  - how to integrate cgconfig and suchlike with systemd

* allow port=0 in .socket units

* move readahead files into /var, look for them with .path units

* teach dbus to activate all services it finds in /etc/systemd/services/org-*.service
* figure out what happened to bluez patch

* get process transport into dbus for systemctl -P/-H

* support systemd.mask= on the kernel command line.

* when key file cannot be found, read it from kbd in cryptsetup

* reuse mkdtemp namespace dirs in /tmp?

* recreate systemd's D-Bus private socket file on SIGUSR2

* Support --test based on current system state

* show failure error string in "systemctl status"

* investigate whether the gnome pty helper should be moved into systemd, to provide cgroup support.

* maybe introduce ExecRestartPre=

* Patch systemd-fsck to use -C and pass console fd to it

* configurable jitter for timer events

* timer evernts with system resume

* Support ProcessNeededForShutdown=true to allow stuff like mdmon to
  be killed very late after the rootfs is read only? If implement pass
  this to shutdown binary via command line argument.

* dot output for --test showing the 'initial transaction'

* calendar time support in timer, iCalendar semantics for the timer stuff (RFC2445)
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=99ee5315dac6211e972fa3f23bcc9a0343ff58c4

* implicitly import "defaults" settings file into all types
* exec settings override
* writable cgroups dbus properties for live changes

* port over to LISTEN_FDS/LISTEN_PID:
   - rpcbind (/var/run/rpcbind.sock!) HAVEPATCH
   - cups     HAVEPATCH
   - postfix, saslauthd
   - apache/samba
   - libvirtd (/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro)
   - bluetoothd (/var/run/sdp! @/org/bluez/audio!)
   - distccd

* auditd service files

* fingerprint.target, wireless.target, gps.target, netdevice.target

* io priority during initialization

* if a service fails too often, make the service enter failed mode, and the socket, too.

* new deps "Triggers" and "TriggeredBy"

* systemctl list-jobs - show dependencies

* add systemctl switch to dump transaction without executing it

* suspend, resume support?

* drop cap bounding set in readahead and other services

External:

* systemd --user
    PR_SET_CHILD_REAPER patch: https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/28/426

* fix alsa mixer restore to not print error when no config is stored

* udisks should not use udisks-part-id, instead use blkid. also not probe /dev/loopxxx

* snd-seq should go, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=676095

* gnome-shell python script/glxinfo/is-accelerated must die

* make cryptsetup lower --iter-time

* patch kernel for xattr support in /dev, /proc/, /sys and /sys/fs/cgroup?

* patch kernel for cpu feature modalias for autoloading aes/kvm/...
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/ak/linux-misc-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/cpuid-match
  (Rafael J. Wysocki's sysdev rework is on the way. After that CPUs can be exported a proper bus.)

* kernel: add /proc/sys file exposing CAP_LAST_CAP? sysconf?

* kernel: add device_type = "fb", "fbcon" to class "graphics"

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)

* Use PR_SET_PROCTITLE_AREA if it becomes available in the kernel

* %m in printf() instead of strerror();

* pahole

* set_put(), hashmap_put() return values check. i.e. == 0 doesn't free()!
