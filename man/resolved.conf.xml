        <listitem><para>A space-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>DNSSEC=</varname></term>
        <listitem><para>Takes a boolean argument or
        <literal>downgrade-ok</literal>. If true all DNS lookups are
        DNSSEC-validated locally (excluding LLMNR and Multicast
        DNS). If a response for a lookup request is detected invalid
        this is returned as lookup failure to applications. Note that
        this mode requires a DNS server that supports DNSSEC. If the
        DNS server does not properly support DNSSEC all validations
        will fail. If set to <literal>downgrade-ok</literal> DNSSEC
        validation is attempted, but if the server does not support
        DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC mode is automatically disabled. Note
        that this mode makes DNSSEC validation vulnerable to
        "downgrade" attacks, where an attacker might be able to
        trigger a downgrade to non-DNSSEC mode by synthesizing a DNS
        response that suggests DNSSEC was not supported. If set to
        false, DNS lookups are not DNSSEC validated.</para>

        <para>Note that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of
        additional DNS data, and thus results in a small DNS look-up
        time penalty.</para>

        <para>DNSSEC requires knowledge of "trust anchors" to prove
        data integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root domain
        is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors may be
        defined with
        <citerefentry><refentrytitle>dnssec-trust-anchors.d</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
        Trust anchors may change in regular intervals, and old trust
        anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is
        not possible until new trust anchors are configured locally or
        the resolver software package is updated with the new root
        trust anchor. In effect, when the built-in trust anchor is
        revoked and <varname>DNSSEC=</varname> is true, all further
        lookups will fail, as it cannot be proved anymore whether
        lookups are correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If
        <varname>DNSSEC=</varname> is set to
        <literal>downgrade-ok</literal> the resolver will
        automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a case.</para>

        <para>Client programs looking up DNS data will be informed
        whether lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the
        returned data could not be verified (either because the data
        was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not
        support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known). In
        the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ a
        secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should
        this be required.</para>

        <para>It is recommended to set <varname>DNSSEC=</varname> to
        true on systems where it is known that the DNS server supports
        DNSSEC correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates
        happen regularly. On other systems it is recommended to set
        <varname>DNSSEC=</varname> to
        <literal>downgrade-ok</literal>.</para>
