- Investigate shrinking build size: use klibc or uClibc, or copy whatever
  udev does

- write a man page

- send in kernel patch for REQ_BLOCK_PC, to always set sd and sr set
  retries (scmd->allowed) to <= 1

- Pull SG_IO code into one .c file.
 
- implement callout to device specific serial id code.  The "-c prog" is
  not implemented.

  This needs an implementation of a device specific callout before it can
  be completed. Someone with hardware requiring this needs to send in a
  patch.
