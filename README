udev - a userspace implementation of devfs

For more information on the design, and structure of this project, see the
files in the docs/ directory.

To use:

- Edit the udev.h file and replace the following variables with values
  that make sense for your system:
	#define UDEV_ROOT       "/udev/"
	#define MKNOD           "/bin/mknod"
  The only value most people will have to change is the UDEV_ROOT
  variable, as I doubt you really want device nodes to be created in my
  home directory :)

- Run make to build the project.

- Make sure sysfs is mounted.

- Point /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug at the location of the udev binary that
  is created.  Then plug some block devices in, or other types of
  devices that create dev files in sysfs.  An easy way to do this,
  without any hardware is to use the scsi_debug module to create virtual
  scsi devices.

- Watch as the nodes get created and removed.


Yes this is a really rough first cut, I know.  It's mostly a proof of
concept that this can actually work.  See the TODO file for a list of
things left to be done.

Any comment/questions/concerns please let me know.
