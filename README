udev - a userspace implementation of devfs

For more information on the design, and structure of this project, see the
files in the docs/ directory.

To use:

- You must be running a 2.6 version of the Linux kernel.

- Make sure sysfs is mounted.  udev will figure out where sysfs is mounted, but
  the traditional place for it is at /sys.  You can mount it by hand by running:
  	mount -t sysfs none /sys

- Make sure you have the latest version of the linux-hotplug scripts.  They are
  available at linux-hotplug.sf.net or from your local kernel.org mirror at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/
  They are required in order for udev to work properly.

  If for some reason you do not install the hotplug scripts, you must tell the
  kernel to point the hotplug binary at wherever you install udev at.  This can
  be done by:
	echo "/sbin/udev" > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug

- Build the project:
	make

- Install the project:
	make install

  This will put the udev binary in /sbin, create the /udev and /etc/udev
  directories, and place the udev configuration files in /etc/udev.  You
  will probably want to edit the namedev.* files to create custom naming
  rules.  More info on how the config files are set up are contained in
  comments in the files, and is located in the documentation.

- Add and remove devices from the system and marvel as nodes are created
  and removed in /udev/ based on the device types.

- If you later get sick of it, uninstall it:
	make uninstall


Things are still quite rough, and it's a bit beyond proof of concept
code.  Help is very much appreciated, see the TODO file for a list of
things left to be done.

Any comment/questions/concerns please let me know.
