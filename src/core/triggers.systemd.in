# On removal, we need to run daemon-reload after any units have been

# executed for some reason.
# On upgrade, we need to run daemon-reload after any new unit files
# have been installed, but before %postun scripts in packages get
# executed. %transfiletriggerun gets the right list of files
# but it is invoked too early (before changes happen).
# %filetriggerpostun happens at the right time, but it fires for
# every package.
# To execute the reload at the right time, we create a state
# file in %transfiletriggerun and execute the daemon-reload in
# the first %filetriggerpostun.
